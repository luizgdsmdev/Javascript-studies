#### <a id="Variables"></a> What are variables in Javascript?
Pretty straightforward, a variable is a space located in the memory that will keep track of a value assigned to it.

But what does it mean?  
Well, let's address the memory as a big cabinet that can hold a limited amount of things in it. But just as a cabinet that you could throw things inside, it would get very messy to keep track of things if we deal with it just like a big black hole that eats things.  
Example: Last week, you kept your nice new shoes for your friend's wedding and since then, you added lots of things like other clothes, shoes, your cat, the meatloaf your mom brought, I mean, LOTS of things.  
So now the wedding is in a few hours, and you have no idea of where the shoes are. Are they behind the cat? inside the meatloaf? Do they still exist?  

##### Solution
Now, just like the 16th century, we face the need for a better way to keep things inside other things and guess what, drawers!!!  
Now that we have drawers, we can use them for different things, like one for shoes, another one for the cat, and so on.

###### So variables are just... drawers?
Well, in a sort of sense, they are. Variables are meant to keep track of different values in memory, just like the drawers in your cabinet keep different things inside. So now, when you want to retrieve a value, you no longer need to search the entire cabinet because you know that the shoes are in one of the drawers, so you just go for it.  

But at which drawer? I mean, how do we know that it is in the first one and not at the second? That's where the variables step in; they work as a label for that drawer (space in memory) that holds the shoes (value).
 

###### variables are meant to facilitate the addressing and retrieval of values, as well as process these values in different ways, by acting as a "label" for the value, which is kept in the memory.
